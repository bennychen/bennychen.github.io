I tossed and turned last night, haunted by the sights of last Sunday&#8217;s football match. In that match, our team thrashed the opponent, which I am very proud of. Although there is still a tremendous space for our team to improve, we together have witnessed some progress, more or less.

However, to my disappointment, I was in terrible form in that match and missed an awful lot of chances. What a poor effort! These several days, I&#8217;ve been obsessed by sort of a strong sense of qualm.

OK, it&#8217;s true that this was the first time I&#8217;ve ever played a match in such a big pitch. So I was troubled with my stamina( I only played 30 minutes ) and maybe I was still a bit of nervous and lack of self-confidence. But they are all not reasons or excues for my unstable performance.

I still need more practice. And my tactical awareness and teamwork skill are both needed to be reinforced. Here are some advices that I summerized for myself:

  * Do not be too eager to pass the ball out. Stop and control the ball well first, and then find a teammate in good position to pass the ball. I think this is also my strength, so I should take better advantage of it.
  * Do not always try lob pass. It is not effective most of the time, a through pass is much better.
  * Never be scared to receive the ball. Run to a good position and be ready to receive a pass anytime with full confidence.
  * Even if I play as a winger, do not be too close to the sideline. Keep a proper distance from my mifield teammates, neither too far nor too close.
  * Take part in the defense more.

Next time, I hope I can contribute more to my team and gain a much better performance. And when can I break my goal drought? Wish that won&#8217;t be long^_*
