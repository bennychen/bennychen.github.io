<p id="entradeta">
  <strong>The third highest goalscorer in Barça is leaving. But he can walk out the front door after five years at the club, winning almost </strong><strong>everything on offer including last year’s memorable treble.</strong>
</p>

<a href="http://www.bennychen.cn/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/29-05-09_etoo_copas_01.jpg" class="highslide-image" onclick="return hs.expand(this);"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-462" title="29-05-09_etoo_copas_01" src="http://www.bennychen.cn/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/29-05-09_etoo_copas_01.jpg" alt="29-05-09_etoo_copas_01" /></a>**他，拥有着巴萨进球数量第3高记录的得分手，不得不和我们说再见了。但是，他绝对可以骄傲的昂首走出巴萨的大门，因为在诺坎普效力的5年里，他几乎为我们赢得了一切，包括上赛季那永恒难忘的三冠王。**

It is time to say goodbye and thank you to Samuel. The Cameroonian striker, came to the club from Mallorca and is now headed for Inter Milan. In his five seasons, he has scored 130 official goals, making him the third highest goalscorer the club has ever had. Only César (235) and Kubala (196) top his record.

萨默尔，是时候和说再见了，并送上我们最诚挚的感谢。这位喀麦隆射手，从马洛卡来到了巴萨，而现在，他的下一个目的地将是国际米兰。在巴萨效力的这5个赛季里，他打进了130粒正式入球，这使他成为俱乐部历史上进球数量第3高的球员，仅次于塞萨尔（235）和库巴拉（196）。

**Important goals**

Eto’o will never be forgotten, not only for his character and dedication, but also his goals, many of which have proven decisive. Whenever called upon, he would respond, as he did in the final in Paris against Arsenal, where he scored the equaliser, or in Rome, where he opened the scoring against Man United (2-0).

**重要的入球**

埃托奥将被永远载入俱乐部的史册，不仅因为他优秀的个人品质和对俱乐部的孜孜不倦，更因为他所贡献的每一粒宝贵的关键进球。当球队需要他的时候，他总能挺身而出，不管是在巴黎的欧冠决赛赛场（攻入扳平阿森纳的进球），抑或是罗马（打进2：0对曼联的首球）。

**Eight titles
  
** 
  
Those goals meant two Champions league titles for Barça (2005/06 and 2008/09). But they were not the only wins for Eto’o in his time at the Camp Nou. He was also involved in the conquest of three leagues (2004/05, 2005/06 and 2008/09), a Copa del Rey (2008/09) and two Spanish Super Cups (2005/06 and 2006/07).

On an individual level, he was also top league goalscorer in 2005/06.

**八座冠军奖杯**

上面的这些关键进球意味着两座冠军联赛的奖杯（05/06和08/09赛季），但还远远不止这些。他还为诺坎普带来了三座联赛冠军（04/05，05/06和08/09赛季），一座国王杯（08/09赛季），以及两座西班牙超级杯（05/06，06/07赛季）。

至于个人荣誉方面，他也获得了05/06赛季的联赛最佳射手。

**Setting standards
  
** 
  
Samuel Eto’o came to Barça when Frank Rijkaard was manager. He was always a regular starter, playing both midweek and at weekends, and producing a constant flow of goals. He totalled 130 in 200 official outings, and average of 0.65 a match. Whether under Rijkaard or Guardiola, the African was always the main target man for all five years.

**树立了旗帜**

埃托奥是在里杰卡尔德时期来到了巴萨。不管是在周中还是周末的比赛中，他总是保持着定期的首发出场率，并且保持着持续数量的进球。在200场正式比赛中，他总共打入了130粒入球，场均进球率达到0.65。在这5年里，不管是在里杰卡尔德，还是瓜迪奥拉的执教下，埃托奥都是球队的核心球员。

**Exemplary attitude
  
** 
  
His goals were the result of his tremendous attitude. He never stop wanting to win more and more. His winning spirit and the huge demands he made of himself drove him though difficult situations, such as serious injuries that affected his seasons in 2006/07 (when he was injured against Bremen) and 2007/08 (when he was injured in the Gamper, against his future club Inter). But on both occasions he marked his return in the best possible way – by scoring goals.

To bid farewell, he also scored for Barça in the Champions League final and in the last game of the league season, at Riazor. Thank you, Samuel.

**杰出的态度**

他如此之多的进球来源于他对于工作杰出而敬业的态度。他从未停止过追求更多的胜利，他内心对于胜利强烈的渴望驱使着他度过 了一个又一个困境，战胜了困扰他的一个又一个伤病。他曾经先后在06/07赛季对阵不莱梅的比赛中，以及在07/08甘伯杯对阵国际米兰（也是他的未来东家）的比赛中受过重伤。但是，在两次伤愈后，他都用最强力的进球，向世人宣告他的回归。

在即将离开巴萨之际，他也用冠军联赛的入球以及联赛最后一轮在Riazor球场的进球，作了最好的告别。萨默尔，谢谢！
