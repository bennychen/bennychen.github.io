The brand-new World Cup brought by the mysterious African continent is coming!!! The opening match between South Africa and Mexico is in just half an hour.

It should have been the time to fully enjoy myself in football. However, sadly, I am still engaged in my thesis work, because the preliminary oral defense for my postgraduate thesis is just tomorrow. What a time! Oh my goodness, I am still rehearsing my defense presentation, while watching TV to wait for the first World Cup match at the same time. Hopefully tomorrow everything will be alright.

God bless me. God bless Africa.
  
And, God bless Spain & Argentina.
  
God bless Messi. God bless Xavi. God bless Iniesta.
