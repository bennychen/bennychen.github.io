**巴萨在他们新赛季的第一场季前赛——在温布利杯对阵托特纳姆热刺的比赛中，收获了一场平局。在这场有些娱乐性的对抗中，瓜迪奥拉给了好几个球员表现的机会，博扬在上半场为球队取得了进球。
  
** 

Kicking off the 2009/10 campaign, the Blaugrana produced a positive display in a game that saw them use 22 players as the team that began was completely replaced at half-time. No less than 15 of those players came from the club&#8217;s youth system, while Víctor Valdés, Rafa Márquez, Maxwell, Aliaksandr Hleb, Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry watched from the sides as they were not in the squad.

Despite the number of youngsters, Barça showed some great touches and enjoyed their fair share of possession against a Tottenham side that were playing in their fourth first-team friendly of the summer.

在这场拉开2009-10新赛季大幕的比赛中，红蓝军团展现了一种非常积极的面貌。上场比赛的球员一共达到了22人，因为在半场时，所有的 11人都得到了更换。至少有15名球员是来自俱乐部的青训系统，而瓦尔德斯，马奎斯，马克斯维尔，赫莱布，梅西以及亨利这些暂时还没有入队的球员，则直接在看台上观看了这场比赛。

尽管使用了相当多的年轻球员，但在这场与热刺的对抗中，巴萨还是体现了相当强大的触控球能力。这场比赛也是热刺一线队今夏的第四场赛季前热身赛。

**Barça style**

While the first match of pre-season is usually a casual affair, Barça had little time to settle down as the Wembley Cup ensured that the team faced a stern test and they stood up well. Guardiola&#8217;s side maintained their style and system as they played the ball around well in midfield against a side that ensured that their defence was well-manned. Early on there were few chances, but the best came in the 20th minute when Bojan saw his effort tipped wide by Carlo Cudicini in the Tottenham goal.

**巴萨风格**

虽然季前赛的第一场比赛一般是以一种随意轻松的态度去应战，但对于巴萨来说，时间不允许他们这么做，因为，温布利杯对于球队就是一场严峻的考验。但是他们经受住了考验，比赛中，瓜迪奥拉的球队保持了他们一贯的风格和系统，他们在中场出色的控球很好的遏制了对方，以确保他们防守组织的也很好。开场时，有好几个机会，最好的机会出现在上半场20分钟，博扬的射门被热刺门将库迪奇尼用指尖碰出。

**Bojan opens the scoring**

The Catalan striker did not allow the keeper to have any chance soon after as the ball fell to him six yards from goal and he stroked home the opening goal. Touré Yaya set up the effort with a super driving run that saw him skip past several Tottenham players before a tackle from Tom Huddlestone took the ball into Bojan&#8217;s path. It was the first goal of the pre-season for the Blaugrana and the second could have come soon after but Pedro was offside before beating Cudicini.

Towards the end of the first half, Tottenham raised their game and enjoyed two chances as Luka Modric struck the crossbar and soon after Benoit Assou-Ekotto saw his drive tipped over by Albert Jorquera.

**博扬打破僵局**

当皮球落到其跟前距离球门只有6码处的时候，加泰罗尼亚前锋这次没有给对方门将任何机会，一个抽射，帮助球队率先取得了进球。而这个进球主要归功于亚亚·图雷，亚亚从中场开始，以一股超强劲的盘带越过了好几名热刺的防守队员，直到哈德斯通的一个铲球使得球落到了博扬的脚下。这也是红蓝军团季前赛取得的第一个进球。他们本可以取得第二个进球，但是佩德罗的进球被吹罚了越位而取消。

在上半场临近结束时，热刺开始发威，并取得了两个进球机会，但是埃克托的射门被巴萨门将霍尔克拉用指尖碰出，而摩德利奇的射门则击中了横梁。

**Livermore equalises**

At the break Guardiola changed his entire team and part of the eleven that started the second period was Henrique, who made his debut alongside Marc Muniesa at the back for Barcelona. While the Blaugrana maintained their form, Tottenham&#8217;s changes ensured that they too altered their game and they were able to raise their game in the closing minutes. That pressure led to an equaliser as Assou-Ekotto&#8217;s centre from a short corner was met by Jake Livermore, who beat José Manuel Pinto to head home.

**里维摩尔扳平比分**

中场休息时，瓜地奥拉完全更换了球队的11人阵容，亨里克在下半场获得了出场机会，这也是他在巴萨的处子秀，他和穆尼艾萨搭档中后卫。巴萨维持了阵型，但热刺进行了一些调整，以确保他们能够更改比赛的局势并在比赛的最后时刻大举反攻。他们的持续施压取得的成效，在一次短角球战术中，埃克托的传中被里维摩尔顶进了平托把守的球门，扳平比分。
